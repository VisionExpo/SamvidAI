## 🧭 Development Phases

SamvidAI was developed iteratively across four phases:

1. **Problem Validation & System Design**  
   Defined the problem, constraints, and architecture.

2. **Synthetic Data Experiments**  
   Validated retrieval, prompting, and risk logic using controlled contracts.

3. **Prototype (CLI / Scripts)**  
   Built and tested the full pipeline on real legal documents.

4. **UI + Feedback Loop**  
   Added Streamlit UI, FastAPI APIs, deployment constraints, and evaluation tracking.
